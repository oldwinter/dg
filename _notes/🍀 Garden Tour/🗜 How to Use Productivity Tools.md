>[!INFO]+ Tip
> Ignoring idiots and geniuses, the work of ordinary people in the middle, in many cases, is already a competition of proficient use of various professional software and integrated tools.

And frankly, the proficient use of various tools has had a decisive impact on my first 3 years in the workplace. I hope to gradually summarize these experiences, improve myself, and help you.
