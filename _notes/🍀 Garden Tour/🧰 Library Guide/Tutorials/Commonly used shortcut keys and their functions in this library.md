title: Commonly used shortcut keys and their functions in this library

up:: [[🍀 Garden Tour/🧰 Library Guide/🧰 Library Usage Guide]]

## **Core five-piece suit**

- cmd + p: call out the command palette
	- Replaced with the [[Cards/Better Command Palette]] plugin, shortcut key cmd + option + p. Compared with the built-in one, it supports tag-based search and other rich custom options.
	- There is a problem with mixed Chinese and English, which leads to some commands being thought to be searchable in English, but must be searched in Chinese, and the translation of English may be adjusted in version updates. For example, the theme of the original night mode was called dark mode, and after the version update, it became dark mode. This resulted in the inability to search with the original word "dark". I have decided to switch the language of Obsidian to English, so that the keywords for many command searches will be more uniform and unchanged.
- cmd + o: call out the file quick switcher panel
	- Replaced with the [[🍀 花园导览/🧰 本库指南/Obsidian/Plugins/Another Quick Switcher]] plugin, shortcut key cmd + option + o. Compared with the built-in one, it supports more content search and rich custom options.
- cmd + t: call out the tab quick switcher panel
	- New: Requires installation of [[🍀 花园导览/🧰 本库指南/Obsidian/Plugins/Quick Switcher++]]. The logic of this command is different from that of the cmd + o command in that this command opens the file in a new tab page.
- cmd + alt + f: call out the full-text search panel of the entire library
	- Replaced with the [[Cards/Omnisearch]] plugin, shortcut key cmd + option + f. Except that Chinese phrases composed of whole sentences are not highlighted, and English double quotation marks " must be added, for example, search for `"whole sentences are not highlighted"`. In other aspects, it is better than the built-in search.
- control + tab: [[Switch recent tabs]]
	- New: Requires installation of [[🍀 花园导览/🧰 本库指南/Obsidian/Plugins/Tab Switcher]] plugin and manual configuration of shortcut keys. After using this shortcut key, the sense of happiness is overwhelming. [[Arc Browser]] and [[Spaces/3-Resource/Software-Sorting/macos-software/VSCode]] both have this shortcut key, which greatly improves efficiency. Try it more and you will feel the benefits I said.
	- It complements the [[🍀 花园导览/🧰 本库指南/Obsidian/Plugins/Quick Switcher++]] plugin.

## **Daily log flow**

- cmd + shift + j: open today's log
- cmd + shift + h: open yesterday's log
- [[2023-02-27]] update: With the help of the [[Cards/Daily Note Outline]] plugin, it is more convenient to manage multi-day logs. I think it is better than the [[Calendar/_ Calendar Readme]] plugin.

## **Daily review flow**

- cmd + shift + 0: open [[Cards/Spaced Repetition]] note review
- cmd + shift + 1: mark as simple
- cmd + shift + 2: mark as difficult

**In addition to the above super high-frequency shortcut keys, other scenarios**:

- If it is high-frequency text editing, you can consider customizing and memorizing shortcut keys. It is recommended to unify the shortcut keys of your commonly used other text editors, such as [[vscode code editing and obsidian text editing shortcut keys - trigger shortcut keys]]. Here are a few examples.
	- cmd + b, bold
	- cmd + a, select all
	- cmd + l, switch to task item
	- cmd + e, edit mode/read mode switch
	- cmd + [, back
	- cmd + ], forward
- In other low and medium frequency scenarios, I try to execute operations through the command palette called by cmd + p.
- In addition to shortcut keys and the command palette. I operate other things through various icons on the interface, which are all effective with one click. See [[🍀 Garden Tour/🧰 Library Guide/Tutorials/This library's workspace, interface division logic and icons]].
	- There will be no icons that require you to click with the mouse and then enter something with the keyboard to take effect. This kind of icon is very anti-human and anti-logical to click. For example, the common word-like editing buttons in other editors.
	- My overall usage principle, see [[Comparison and selection of shortcut keys, icons, and command lines]].
