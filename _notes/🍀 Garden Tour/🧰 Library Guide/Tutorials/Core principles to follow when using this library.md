## Core Principles

>[!TIP]
> Obey them as unshakably as the constitution

- The capture and recording of fleeting thoughts, it is better to do more than not to do.
- Make sure that 80% of the content in the library is output by yourself.
	- 2025-07-05 update: In the AI era, the thinking has changed. You can and must clip, so that AI can more easily extract the context. Refer to [[In the AI era, clipping is not for reading later, but to tell AI what I like by Yubo]]
- Make sure that 80% of the notes in the library have been [[Independent Thinking\|independently thought]] by yourself.
- [[Write notes for yourself by default, don't consider readers]].
- Fancy tricks only serve high-frequency scenarios. Forget the tricks that are rarely used.
- Use spaced repetition to fight against forgetting. It is better to forget less than to learn more.
