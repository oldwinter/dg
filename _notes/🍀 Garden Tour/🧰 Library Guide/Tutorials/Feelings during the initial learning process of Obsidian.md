- [[Fleeting Notes]]
	- Capture all potential high-value thoughts or information in the brain every day.
- Two-way linking
	- The establishment cost is extremely low, just two square brackets, so the brain is more willing to connect and recall
	- and search instantly
	- The final local [[Cards/knowledge graph]] brings great value in promoting association and thinking
- Knowledge Graph
	- The more cards there are, the stronger the connectivity, and the value grows quadratically. Its ultimate value may depend on its number of points, as [[Metcalfe's Law]] says
	- Most of the time it's useless. Maybe watching it expand brings a sense of accomplishment, which is an important role.
- Bottom-up
	- You will no longer have to experience the pain of not knowing anything when writing a thesis and having to build a framework from top to bottom.
	- Before writing, the knowledge points are actually scattered in the usual accumulation, and you only need to piece them together.
- Review memory
