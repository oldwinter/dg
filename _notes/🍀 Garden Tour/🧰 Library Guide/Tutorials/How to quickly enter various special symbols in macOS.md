- You can see emoji and all special characters in bulk in "Edit - Emoji & Symbols" in the upper left corner. But it is very troublesome to input without shortcut keys.
- The way to find the shortcut key is: in the input method settings, enable the virtual keyboard, and then use the modifier key to see the shortcut keys for each character. The yellow box means a conflicting key.
As shown in the figure below, after holding down the option key, the characters that can be entered and the conflicting shortcut keys will be displayed.
