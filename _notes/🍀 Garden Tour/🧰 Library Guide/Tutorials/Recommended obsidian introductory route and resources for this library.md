## Watching videos is the fastest way to get started in 2022

- [[Johnny's]] introductory course: [Johnny's open class, the first episode, a nearly 3-hour introductory course for Obsidian beginners, all are basic knowledge, you can get started with OB after learning it, and no community plugins are mentioned_bilibili_bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1i3411k7TQ?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=c16ee9cfb2023d2af8428dbfe604b72f)
	- Don't just watch it episode by episode. Skip the content you already know or are not interested in. **Never just watch the video, you must follow along and operate it yourself, this is very important.**
- [Perhaps the best Obsidian novice tutorial on Bilibili! After 30 days of hard work, a one-stop introduction to the two-way link note-taking software_bilibili_bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18a411r7mt?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click)
	- Watch this video and get excited, maybe it will make you more determined to start learning obsidian. Although it's exciting, I only used less than 20% of the functions mentioned in the video.
- In the subsequent use and learning process, if a certain problem or solution is very specific, then, please believe me, someone on Bilibili or youtube must have made a related teaching video, make good use of the search. For example: zotero, markdown, slides and other keywords.

## Practice while watching the video, and search for keywords in the documentation if you have any questions

- Quickly go through the official help documentation: [Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/)
	- In fact, for me personally (a programmer who is familiar with efficiency tools), **operating it once** by following the official help documentation is the fastest way to get started.
- In the process of practice, if you encounter problems, you can first search the help documentation of [[Luoshanji]], which is very comprehensive: [Obsidian Chinese Tutorial - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/chinesehelp)
	- Other various articles can basically be found in the index of Luoshanji's help documentation. Thanks again to this 🐔 in words.
	- This young lady wrote a series of introductory articles that are easy to understand. I'd like to recommend them separately: [Lilian's Obsidian Article MOC - Experience Sharing - Obsidian Chinese Forum](https://forum-zh.obsidian.md/t/topic/324).
	- If you have a soft spot for plugins, this Taiwanese friend has made nearly 100 videos explaining the use of various plugins: [Jerry's personal space_bilibili_bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/1119961064). The key is that he **has an article for each video**. Novices watch videos, and veterans read articles, each takes what he needs, and the learning efficiency is excellent.
- New, coffee bean obsidian getting started guide is very detailed and attentive https://coffeetea.top/zh/

## Then look at other people's sample libraries

- [[obsidian-out-of-the-box-example-library]]
	- Various sample libraries are also comprehensive and beautified. Please be careful not to get lost. Just imitate and learn what is useful to you. Always remind yourself that the first purpose of your note library is to serve yourself, to help you think, ask questions, and make decisions better, not to beautify it for others to see and get recognition.

## The least recommended way, but I have to mention it here

Join various QQ or WeChat groups. But be aware that 99% of the discussion content has nothing to do with you, so when you join such groups, please be aware of your purpose, which should be to obtain resources or information faster, and avoid getting lost and wasting too much time chatting with group members.

- 1,000-person QQ group number: 774176839
- Bilibili Johnny, he has multiple 500-person WeChat novice groups. Just send him a private message.
- Bilibili Sha Niu, also has multiple 500-person WeChat novice groups. Add his assistant's WeChat to join the group.
- There is also a "Weike Note" official account, which has created a knowledge planet. If you are interested, you can follow it.

A relatively more valuable way is discord, where developers and all active core users gather, but the communication environment is in English and requires a VPN.

- The discord address is under the official community: [Community - Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/community)
