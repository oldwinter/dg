[[The features and details of obsidian that I can't put down]] mentioned that obsidian has the least customized changes to markdown compared to other note-taking software. So you may have seen similar conclusions in many places. Among many note-taking software, obsidian is the best for writing long articles or blogs for this reason.

The official markdown syntax guide for obsidian: [Format your notes - Obsidian Chinese Help - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/help-zh/%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97/%E6%A0%BC%E5%BC%8F%E5%8C%96%E4%BD%A0%E7%9A%84%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0)
In order to be compatible with traditional blogs or major platforms that support markdown syntax, I am also very restrained in my use of obsidian's markdown syntax. In summary, unless necessary, I will definitely not introduce html tags or css syntax to enhance the layout. In total, I only use these common pure markdown syntaxes:

- `[[]]` two-way link syntax, currently not a markdown standard
- head titles 2-4
- highlight and bold
- unordered and ordered lists
- image and file insertion syntax `[]()`
- quote and callout syntax
- code block
- table
- footnote
- comment
