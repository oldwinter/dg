title: This library does not recommend doing task management in obsidian
---
You may find that I have hardly used the `-[]` checklist syntax that can be checked in this library. Instead, I use the `#todo` tag for simple task management.

I have also tried to use task management plugins such as dataview's task syntax, community's tasks, and community's KANBAN to enhance the capabilities of obsidian.

But unfortunately, obsidian's data management method based on md has natural defects. Intermediate state data such as tasks will bring a lot of pollution to the md plain text, which is not conducive to later retrieval and reorganization. Basic operations such as task check-in, repetition, timing, reminders, and postponement are too troublesome to do in obsidian.

And another important point. A task often needs to be completed by multiple people. The localized feature of obsidian also determines that it is currently only applicable to personal task management, which has great limitations.

But the use of the two-way link syntax can indeed play some role after we integrate task management into obsidian. What should we do if we can't bear to part with it?

After a comprehensive trade-off, I use the `#todo` tag for simple task management in obsidian, and complex other task management is still handed over to tools such as [[Spaces/3-Resource/Software-Sorting/android-software/TickTick]].

Update: In obsidian's official roadmap, the whiteboard feature and task management feature are planned, and it is estimated that it will take at least 3 months. We can look forward to whether the official work can help us perfectly manage tasks in obsidian.
