title: This library does not recommend too many fancy tricks in obsidian
---
Perhaps, at your first glance at this library, you may be a little disappointed. Compared with cuman or rainbell or other sample libraries, it seems a bit simple. The interface color scheme is a bit "cold", and you can't see a few visual icons, so you don't know where to start.

But please believe me, the library you see now was once a very complex version, and I have borrowed and introduced many fancy tricks. For example: quickly search and insert data from Douban Reading and Movies through quickadd, introduce React plugins to make the homepage interface very beautiful, use a large number of templater templates to automatically generate files, use various plugins to make video notes, daily check-ins, automatic review and summary, etc. I have also installed and deeply experienced more than 200 plugins.

I have played with all of these. But, it is only limited to playing. These transformations of obsidian can only be regarded as treating obsidian as a toy, not a tool. To be honest, I did not get any feeling of thinking efficiency from it, but I can show it off in front of my friends, saying how cool and awesome my tool is, and how骚浪牛批无极限 my operation is.

What else? Taking notes requires a simpler method that allows us to persevere without violating human nature and wasting time. A system that allows me to easily record some key things without pressure even if I am very busy and tired at work today. And many fancy and tricky things make the friction of this process extremely high.

follow your heart, taking notes is to make yourself think better. Stop stuffing your obsidian with plugins and fancy tricks that you may have played with a few times and will never use again.
