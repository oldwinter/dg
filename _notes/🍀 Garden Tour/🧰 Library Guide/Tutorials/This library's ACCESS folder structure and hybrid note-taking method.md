x:: [[Hybrid Note-taking Method]]

- From the content of the note itself:
	- Local and overall. Local is the knowledge point of a certain subdivision, and overall is all the content that you are interested in.
	- [[Top-down]] and [[Bottom-up]]. The former is similar to a mind map, one divides into two, two divides into four, first have a skeleton, then fill in the content. The latter first accumulates isolated knowledge points in a scattered manner, and when it accumulates to a certain extent, it forms a local aggregation, first have the content, then draw the skeleton.
- From the perspective of note organization:
	- [[N xx firsts for organizing notes in obsidian]]
- From the perspective of note-taking practice:
	- [[🍀 Garden Tour/🧰 Library Guide/Tutorials/How to organize and build folders and directories for note-taking]]
- Atalas
	- Overall, [[Top-down]], overlooking the overall situation
- Calendar
	- dailynote first, based on daily logs
	- Overall, [[Bottom-up]], accumulating from small things.
	- Reduce input friction and provide clues for review based on dates
- Cards
	- content first, based on the content itself
	- link first, try to establish as many connections as possible
	- Locally, [[Bottom-up]].
	- How to organize and sort?
		- Natural degradation, cards that have not been opened for a long time are useless cards. Just let them go.
		- Natural growth, high-frequency opened cards, try to establish more connections with other pages. Create a new MOC for aggregation when necessary.
- Extras
- Sources：
	- material first, based on the carrier form of learning materials
	- topic first, based on topics and themes
	- architect first, structure first, respect the structure of the original material.
	- Locally, [[Top-down]].
	- Provide clues for review based on materials. When there is a conflict or overlap with Spaces, give priority to this place.
- spaces
	- action first, based on actions and goals
	- folder first, folder first, as a workbench to guide actions and goals.
	- Locally, [[Top-down]]+[[Bottom-up]].
	- Provide clues for review based on projects and actions.
