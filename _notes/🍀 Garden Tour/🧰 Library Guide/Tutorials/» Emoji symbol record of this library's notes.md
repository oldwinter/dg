## Why introduce emoji to file names?

Some concepts in the cards can be gathered together and marked with special marks, which is also convenient for searching and quoting. If you use letters or symbols as prefixes, letters are likely to cause excessive matching in searches, and symbols are not enough. Finally, I thought of using emoji 😃.

Of course, you can also achieve the same effect through the tag + [[🍀 花园导览/🧰 本库指南/Obsidian/Plugins/Supercharged Links]] plugin, but you cannot directly search by file name, which is inconvenient to quote.

You don't have to pursue a complete and complete classification. The important thing is to form this habit. When creating a new entry, you can consciously use emoji symbols to distinguish them.

MOC uses the `+` symbol as a prefix to make it appear at the front in natural sorting, which is convenient for both searching and being seen first in the folder.
, decided to use the `∑` symbol in batches, option+w input. Because + is too commonly used, there will be too much interference when searching, and it may be recognized as a reserved character by some systems and cause errors, such as the 404 problem in [[Sources/GithubStarsSync/hugo]].
option +w is used as the shortcut key for [[Spaces/3-Resource/Software-Sorting/macos-software/Raycast]] to specify opening [[Spaces/3-Resource/软件梳理/macos软件/Warp]], so the `∑` symbol is abandoned, and TOC is not commonly used, so the `§` symbol is used as the prefix.

TOC uses the `§` symbol as a prefix (option+6 input, pay attention to possible shortcut key conflicts), so that it is at the forefront of natural sorting, which is convenient for searching and being seen first in the folder.

The workflow uses the `»` symbol as a prefix, option+shift+\ input.
