Question:

- What level of reader is this instruction for, and what does it bring to the reader?
- Am I [[🪞Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime\|teaching a man to fish or giving him a fish]]?
- Do I actually use it this way myself? Will I mislead others?

Steps:

- Find a suitable place in [[🍀 Garden Tour/🧰 Library Guide/Tutorials/∑ This library's ACCESS workflow summary]] to insert new links and create new ones.
