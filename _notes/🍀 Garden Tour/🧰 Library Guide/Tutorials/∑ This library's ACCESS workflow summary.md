title: ∑ This library's ACCESS workflow summary
---
up: [[ACCESS Note Organization Method]]

According to the different goals of using obsidian, it is divided into 3 levels, the difficulty gradually increases, and varies from person to person. For more level divisions, see [[Different people's usage of obsidian]].

1. Use the obsidian library as a card note box. Only use obsidian for daily flash thoughts, work log records, etc.
	- Use [[» Daily notes workflow]], just keep the Calendar and Cards folders, and delete all other folders that are not used.
2. Use obsidian as a [[Spaces/2-Area/∑ PKM]] system. At this time, it is also necessary to consider the digestion, processing, and review of various information and knowledge sources such as articles and videos.
	- Materials of different carriers are processed through the workflow under the Sources folder.
	- Action-oriented things with expected completion times are classified and processed through the workflow under the Spaces folder.
	- After the content increases, you need to place various external resources in the Extras folder and aggregate them through the MOC under Atlas.
	- For to-do processing and review, see: [[» My tag usage workflow]], [[🍀 Garden Tour/🧰 Library Guide/Tutorials/» My Review Workflow]].
3. Use obsidian as a life management operating system. Friends, you may have found that this library only uses the todo tag for simple schedule management, and it strongly emphasizes not to directly clip various things into the obsidian library, and try to focus on [[Spaces/2-Area/∑ PKM]]. For other peripheral links, my current judgment is that it is not suitable to do them in obsidian, although many geeky friends have implemented them.
	- My thoughts and practices will be continuously updated in [[∑ Construction of efficiency system for work and life]].
