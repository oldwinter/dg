title: 🧰 Library Usage Guide

>[!INFO] Tip
> This library does not do task management, beautification and layout, etc. It tries to focus on the text content itself and is relatively simple to use. Even so, if you still encounter usage questions after reading this page, you are welcome to come and discuss: [Discussions · oldwinter/knowledge-garden · GitHub](https://github.com/oldwinter/knowledge-garden/discussions)

Compatibility description: [[🍀 Garden Tour/🧰 Library Guide/Tutorials/Explanation of this library's compatibility on different operating systems]]

Update goal: to create an out-of-the-box library for college students and new professionals with **independent thinking ability**, and by the way, to find like-minded people and get opportunities to communicate with outstanding young people.

This library usage guide will be developed around the following 3 aspects:

- How to use the obsidian software itself efficiently.
- How to build a personal second brain/knowledge base.
- How to publish and share your own digital garden/knowledge base.
